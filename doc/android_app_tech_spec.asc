= Android App Technical Specification

Technical specification for an Android app to scan your own book's barcode and add that book to the librarian database.

The basic scanning and lookup functions are taken care of by utilising the tutorial code at the Mobiletuts+ tutorial series by Sue Smith.  Database detection an storage are original code.  The communication with the database will be either via direct database connection or through an public facing API.  The API will provide greater flexibility as this can be accessed wherever a WiFi connection is available.  Direct connection is however, the way the current Python application already queries the database and in most cases we keep our libraries within our house where, again, in most places a direct WiFi connection will be available. 

== Database Communication and Storage

The app should not assume that a connection to the DB is always available so some temporary on-device storage needs to be used until a DB connection is established.  MySQLite will be the ideal candidate for this.  Once a DB connection is established the data can be uploaded and the temporary storage removed.

On successful lookup the book data are stored in savedInstanceState as a set of get-able variables
