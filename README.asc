== README FIRST

Requires some flavour of Linux and Python >= 2.7.  
Windows users will have to figure out how it works themselves and edit 
the code to suit.
....
Also requires the python packages:
biblio.webquery - For ISBN lookup  
zbar  
copy
pygtk
gtk 
amazonlookup - For CD barcode lookup
MySQLdb - For MySQl database or
sqlite3  - For sqlite database
reportlab - For PDF report generation
qrencode - For QR code generation
....

Some of these can be installed by running:
[source,bash]
pip install -r requirements.txt

Get the code with:
[source,bash]
----
git clone git://github.com/EvansMike/librarian.git
----

Install with: (On a Fedora system)
[source,bash]
----
pip install biblio.webquery # NB. Not required for latest code.
yum install zbar-pygtk pygtk MySQL-python # If you're using Fedora

python setup.py install
----

I wanted to catalog all my books using their barcodes as input and track who
borrows my books.  That's all.  I looked online for a program that would
do just that and couldn't find any that supported barcode input.  The idea
of typing in book details didn't appeal, so wrote this.

This is a simple application to catalogue your library using the ISBN barcode
and the zbarcam application with an ordinary webcam.
The scan triggers a lookup on the database and the book details are downloaded
then committed to the local database.

It uses MySQL or sqlite.  The database config file is created if none exists.

Use database.schema.sql, after creating the database,  to populate the database with
the required tables:
[source,sql]
----
mysql -p books < database.schema.sql
----
You have to create the database first using your favourite method/tool.
The database name (books in the example above) can be anything as long as the
config file matches.  If the config file contains a password so take care to 
make it secure from prying eyes.

Can also use sqlite.  Edit db_conf.cfg to use whatever database you like.
Sqlite is easier to set up but not so useful if you want to access the data from 
multiple computers.

=== QR Codes
Every time you scan a book a QRcode can be generated. You may not want this behaviour.
BY default the behaviour is turned off in the config file.
It seemed like a good idea at the time but I admit to never have used the 
QRcodes for anything. :)

Older books without bar codes can be manually input via the Query/Edit book
window.  It's a bit of a pain though if you have lots of books.

=== DB Notes
To get a list of borrowed books from mysql:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT o_date, title, author, borrowers.name
  FROM borrows, borrowers, books
  WHERE borrows.borrower = borrowers.id
  AND books.id = borrows.book
  AND borrows.i_date IS NULL;
----

The sqlite2 database file is created from the database.schema.sql file with:
[source,bash]
----
./mysql2sqlite3 --no-data  -p books | sqlite3 database_schema.db
----


=== Update:  2012-04-12 
You can now scan DVDs and CDs provided you have a Amazon web
services account.  http://aws.amazon.com to sign up.  As far as I know, low
useage will attract no charge, likely to be most domestic users.
CD lookup uses Amazon to get CD data from the barcode, if it's not in
Amazon's database this will fail.  Not sure what other databases there are 
for CD case barcodes.  Perhaps an application to add CD's as they are played 
using freedb?

Setting user database password stuff is up to you for the moment.  
I will add a GUI. NOTE:  Passwords are stored as plain text in the config file.  
On first run a default .db_config.cnf file is
written in your home directory, note that this is a hidden dot-file.  
This must edited with the details of your database plus any other preferences.

To create the tables you will need the books_schema.sql  file from the sources.
After creating the database run: mysql <-p> books < books_schema.sql to 
create the tables.  The -p is required if your DB is password protected.
Obviously you can call the DB anything you like, it doesn't have to be 
books, as long as the .db_config.cfg file contains matching details.

To get who borrowed what and for how long:
[source,sql]
----
  SELECT title, name, DATEDIFF(i_date,o_date) AS days 
      FROM borrows, borrowers, books 
      WHERE borrows.borrower=borrowers.id 
      AND books.id=borrows.book;
----      

=== Update:  2016-04-06

I've changed to book lookup to use several sources for book data. The main lookup is to http://xisbn.worldcat.org/  but this doesn't provide an abstract so that comes from googleapis.com/books.

NOTE: The DVD and CD lookup functions rely on too many disparate data sources ever work reliably. I wouldn't bother personally. (Of course I'll welcome pull requests).

There's a companion android app for updating and querying the library database but it's currently coded to only work with my API/SQLserver. It's currently very basic but it allows you to add books using the barcode scanner in your android device. I really should do some more work on it but I really don't see it ever being worth the effort as it's would be onerous to turn this into an app worthy of Google play store.


=== Windows Users

Apologies to MS Windows, and Mac users, I don't use MS Windows or a Mac myself so I have no way to 
develop or test code other than on Linux.  You will have to adapt the code 
to suit.

Stuff that need fixing for MS Windows include zbarcam code in guiscan.py, 
database connections to anything other than MySQl and sqlite3 is also not
currently supported.
