A small warning  Everytime you scan a book a qrcode is generated and place in the directory above the current directoryYou may not want this behaviour.  It's trivial to delete/move the created codes however.  I should put a config option for this behaviour or place the qrcodes somewhere else.  It seemed like a good idea at the time but I admit to never using the qrcode for anything. :)


NOTES:
To get a list of borrowed books from mysql:
SELECT o_date, title, author, borrowers.name
  FROM borrows, borrowers, books
  where borrows.borrower = borrowers.id
  and books.id = borrows.book
  and borrows.i_date IS NULL;
