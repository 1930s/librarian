README FIRST

Requires some flavour of linux and Python.

I wanted to catalog all my books using gtheir barcodes as input and track who
borrows my books.  That's all.  I looked online for a program that would
do just that and couldn't find any, so wrote this.

This is a simple application to catalogue your library using the ISBN barcode
and the zbarcam application with an ordinary webcam.
The scan triggers a lookup on the database and the book details are downloaded
then commited to the local database.

It uses MySQL.  The database config file is created if none exists.  Use database.sql
to create the database, like:
mysql -p books < database.sql
te database name (books in the example above) can be anything as long as the
config file matches.  If the config file contains a password take care to make
it secure from prying eyes.

Requires biblio and zbar.  If you want qrcode then also needs qrencode. :)

Currently borrowers have to manually inserted into the database on the command line.
I will fix this if I get asked or I can be motivated.

See INSTALL for install instructions.

A small warning  Everytime you scan a book a qrcode is generated and place
in the directory above the current directory You may not want this behaviour.
It's trivial to delete/move the created codes however.  I should put a
config option for this behaviour or place the qrcodes somewhere else.
It seemed like a good idea at the time but I admit to never have used the qrcodes for anything. :)
PS. Now removed this 'feature'.  If you want it then modify the source code in add-edit.py
I could write a script to create all of the QRCodes from the DB info if at
some time I change my mind and decide I need them after all.

Older books without bar codes can be manually input via the Query/Edit book
interface.  It's a bit od a pain though of you have lots of books.



DB NOTES:
To get a list of borrowed books from mysql:
SELECT o_date, title, author, borrowers.name
  FROM borrows, borrowers, books
  where borrows.borrower = borrowers.id
  and books.id = borrows.book
  and borrows.i_date IS NULL;

To insert a borrower in the mysql shell:
insert into borrowers(name) values ('Borrower Name');
It's just a text field, the id is auto incremented.  Obviously there should be a
nice user friendly GUI for this. :)
