This is all based on a Linux system.

To use just copy everything here into a new directory and run librarian.py.
Create a database then run:
mysql -p $DB_NAME < database.schema.db
Omit the -p if you don't use a DB password.  Change $DB_NAME.  If an existing 
database.table exists with the same name it will NOT be overwritten.  I'd 
still recommend making a backup first though.  It may be the only one you'll
ever make and you'll thank me one day. :)

An empty config file will be created when run for the first time, edit
this to reflect your database settings.

The languages part is not implemented although a sample welsh file exists.
See http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?file=faq22.002.htp&req=edit for more info
about implementing your language and how to correctly install.


TODO:
