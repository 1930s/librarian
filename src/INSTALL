The languages part is not implemented although a sample welsh file exists.  See http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?file=faq22.002.htp&req=edit for more info about implementing your language and hoe to correctly install.

The setup.py file doesn't work if you want an application install, it installes the modules in your python path which is probabaly not what you want.
